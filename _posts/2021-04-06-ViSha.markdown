## Introduction for ViSha
**ViSha** is a short name for "Video shadow detection dataset". ViSha includes 120 videos with diverse content, varying length, and object-level annotations. More than half videos are from 5 widely-used video tracking benchmarks (i.e., OTB[1], VOT[2], LaSOT[3], TC-128[4], and NfS[5]). The remaining 59 videos are self-captured with different hand-held cameras, over different scenes, at varying times. The frame rate is adjusted to 30 fps for all video sequences.  
Eventually, **ViSha** contains 120 video sequences, with a totally of 11,685 frames and 390 seconds duration. The longest video contains 103 frames and the shortest contains 11 frames.

## Form of ViSha
To provide guidelines for future works, we randomly split the dataset into training and testing sets with a ratio of 5:7. The 50 training set and 70 testing set can be downloaded *above this page*.

If you download ViSha and unzip each file, you can find the dataset structure as follows:

    ▾ <train>/
        ▾ images/
            ▾ baby_cat/
                00000001.jpg
                ...
            ▾ baby_wave1/
                00000001.jpg
                ...
